      "Distributed applications require scalable storage with data integrity, resilience, and backup, all of which the DART database provides. It is optimised for security, quick retrieval and verfication with unique signets for every new state. It stores data in our sleek HiBON dataformat that provides security, ownership and control (including deletion and modification) for every data point.",

      "Everyone can contribute to the Tagion infrastructure by operating a node in the Mainnet or as part of their individual Federated Database. Tagion's Hashgraph mechanism ensures a deterministic consensus and one source of truth across all nodes. Our patented Wavefront protocol provides efficient synchronisation with no communication overheads and a fair, timebased ordering of transactions, preventing fraud and manipulation common to many blockchain protocols.",

    description:
      "Tagion's goal is to build an infrastructure that is accessible like a public good and governed like a commons. Node operators, core members, ambassadors, and developers, are incentivised and given a vote in the governance of the network. For individual use-cases the data management and participation rules can be customised in independent databases - federated with the Tagion Mainnet.",
