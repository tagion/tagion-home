      "Everyone can provide the tagion infrastructure by operating a node with this delivering the Tagion network. Tagion Hashgraph ensures consensus among nodes, so everyone knows the truth and one truth only. Wavefront protocol provides efficient synchronisation between two nodesâ€™ state of the Hashgraph with no communication overhead, delivering an efficient network consensus mechanism that has ordering and is scalable.",

    description:
      "Distributed applications require scalable storage with data integrity, resilience, and backup, all of which the DART system provides. It efficiently stores SHA-256 hashes using a data structure with 256 leaves. The DART includes a cryptographic fingerprint called a bullseye, which is updated upon modification, ensuring data integrity. Users can create custom sub-darts with their own governance and delete obsolete data.",
