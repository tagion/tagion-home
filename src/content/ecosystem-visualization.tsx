    description: (
      <>
        DART offers distributed and scalable storage for applications, ensuring
        data integrity and back up. You can create customised solutions with
        sub-DARTs with specific case-based rules and integrated trading
        capabilities. The DART can handle large amounts of data efficiently as
        the databases are distributed across nodes, optimising the network
        capacity.
        <br className="br-separator" /> Hashgraph is a revolutionary technology
        that ensures agreement across nodes, offering a secure and reliable
        distrbuted ledger. Unlike traditional blockchains, which rely on
        probability, Hashgraph consensus is deterministic. There is always an
        definitive order of events, so there is greater trust, accuracy and
        reliability in the network.
