This optimises network storage capacity utilisation for high data-intensive systems like CDN. It efficiently stores SHA-256 hashes using a data structure with 256 leaves on each branch. The DART allows for the swift calculation of a cryptographic fingerprint called a bullseye, which is updated upon modification, ensuring data integrity across all nodes. ",

            Seperating data storage and consensus mechanisms allows Tagion to achieve the flexibility, privacy and efficiencies required to offer distributed solutions to business-applications at all scales. The HiBON data format, combined with the DART architecture, along with the Hashgraph and Wavefront protocols mean that Tagion enables volume and speed of transactions previously only possible on centralised systems. All while requiring minimal resources in hard-ware, bandwidth and energy consumptions.

The recorded journals enable replay and undo functions, and they can also aid in synchronising databases. Each node is responsible for maintaining these backups. The distributed nature of the database enhances its resilience by having multiple copies of the data.",

To achieve this we strive for the highest level of inclusivity and openness for new node-operators to join the network and contribute to its resilience.
