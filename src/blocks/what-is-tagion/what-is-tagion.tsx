      At its core, Tagion is a distributed database that combines features from blockchains and traditional centralised architectures. It is the alternative to conventional financial infrastructures that are predominatnly owned by corporations that prioritize shareholder value over user-benefits. 

Tagion is decentralised, meaning that no one actor can gain power over others and that user benefits remain safeguarded. Tagion was designed and implemented based on the following values:
        <div className="text-separator" />
        <div className={cx("cards_wrapper")}>
          {whatIsTagionBlockCardsData.length &&
            whatIsTagionBlockCardsData.map((cardData) => (
              <div className={cx("card")} key={cardData.id}>
                <span className={`${cx("id")} inter_400`}>{cardData.id}</span>
                <span
                  className={`${cx("text")} prompt-400`}
                  style={{
                    width: pageSize && cardData.styles?.[pageSize]?.width,
                  }}
                >
                  {cardData.text}
                </span>
              </div>
            ))}
        </div>
        <div className="text-separator" />
        Different from blockchains, Tagion's software architecture is designed for massive scale. Itâ€™s a so-called Hashgraph system that is capable of handling high volumes of transactions at great speed with high security, low cost and minimal energy consumption. 
        <div className="text-separator" />
        Tagion is a toolbox for developers, communities and entreprises to build locally optimised, globally shared real-world use cases.
